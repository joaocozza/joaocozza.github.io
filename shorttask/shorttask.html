    <h1> Native and Hybrid Web Applications </h1>
    <br> 
    <p> When we are speaking about Native and Hybrid applications for web, we are speaking about 
        apps which works in specific operational systems. Below, we will see the diffrence of <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-phonegap-why-you-should-use-it-for-app-development-5ac5e19eb19a" target="_self">PhoneGap</a>, <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/" target="_self"> VS code Flutter,</a>, and <a href="https://reactnative.dev/architecture/overview" target="_self"> Reactive Native</a>. 
    </p>
    <br> 

    <h1> PhoneGap, VS Code Flutter and React Native. </h1>
    <h2> PhoneGap</h2>
    <p> PhoneGap is an open-source plataform. It allows the developer to build web application for different types of operational systems. To be able to develop web applications, the developer doesn't need to have a lot of knowledge about specific programming language, he just need to have knowledge about web code language such as: HTML, CSS and Java Script. </p>
    
    <p> When developers write code using HTML and CSS, PhoneGap will be the "brigde" between the code and the operational system in which the developer wants to use. </p>

    <br> 

    <h2> VS Code Flutter </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Different than PhoneGap, VS code Flutter is one way to build hybrid applications. Flutter, is an extension of VS Code (program to code), which allows the developer to write code for different plataforms. </li>
    <li> FLutter uses the programming language <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_self"> Dart,</a> which was created by Google.</li> 
    <li> One of the key benefits of Flutter, is its ability to use the same codebase across multiple platforms, which means you can create an app that runs on different devices with minimal modifications.</li>

    </ol>
    
   <br> 

   <h2> React Native</h2>

   <ol>

    <li> <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" target="_self"> React Native </a> is also a tool to develop applications to run in different plataforms. React Native is a programming language which uses JavaScript, and was rooled out by Meta, (Facebook).</li>
   <li> It supports iOS, Android, and Web , Windows and Mac. it is not so popular than Flutter, nevertheless, is a nice tool.</li>
